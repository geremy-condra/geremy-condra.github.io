Hey all, thanks for taking a look at my shiny new website! We'll be testing recipes, kitchen gadgets, gadgets in general, and posting pictures of dogs. It's going to be fun.

## What's coming up?

First I'm just going to get a bunch of my recipes up here, followed by some notes on them and reviews of the various gadgets I use to produce them. But there will also likely be more changes to the website layout and similar as I get going.

## How to use this site?

It's best to think of this as a combination of an archive of my experiments around cooking plus a good place to ideate on those experiments. If you have suggestions on recipes, methodology, or reviews feel free either to leave those in the comments or (preferably) submit a pull request.
