    text: >-
      Put your cucumbers on a tough surface and optionally cover them with something nonporous.
      Get out a large rolling pin (wood or metal, not marble) and hit the cucumbers until they
      split into craggy quarters. There will be a lot of splatter.

    name: Salt the cucumbers.
    text: >-
      Put the cucumbers into a large bowl and salt them thoroughly. Wait 20 minutes, then drain
      and add the other ingredients. Serve before the peanuts get soggy!
