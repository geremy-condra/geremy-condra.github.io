      Nachos are built on chips but defined by their cheese. This recipe uses a mix of pepper jack and queso
      quesadilla to get a bit of heat, great melting properties, and the richness of the queso quesadilla.
      It is not essential that these be fancy, but they should be as flavorful as you can get. I've used Tillamook
      pepper jack and am reasonably happy but their habanero jack would probably be better. Cacique is my preferred
      queso quesadilla. Because both cheeses are such good melters and we are not forming a sauce with them it is
      not essential to buy blocks and shred your own cheese, but it will save you a good bit of money.

      The only requirements for this chorizo are that it be Mexican-style chorizo and not Spainish-style. The
      correct kind will be a fresh sausage usually sold near breakfast sausages in the meat department and will
      have a pronounced red color. It will not be hard, come in slices, or otherwise show signs of having been
      aged. Like many fresh sausages you really have to be paying attention to know the difference between very
      expensive Mexican chorizo and very inexpensive Mexican chorizo, and I cheap out here if I can.

      Most of the time I'm a Juanita's fan but Solena chips lack the pronounced corn grains that make Juanita's
      so good. That's an advantage here: their more delicate texture and higher oil content lead to a sense that 
      you made and fried some really quite good tortillas rather than buying the cheapest bag of chips at the 
      store. My one complaint is that they really are delicate-- if you have more robust but still smooth chips
      available near you go with those, or optionally mix and match. Personally I find the white corn chips wind
      up looking better on the plate, but that's up to you.

    name: Buying hot sauce
    text: >
      There isn't much more personal than your choice of favorite hot sauces so I won't belabor this point. The
      cheese and chorizo here are not hot enough to climb into grade-A nacho territory for me on their own, so
      hot sauce is an essential part of the mix. It should be actually hot, much hotter than Tobasco or sriracha,
      in order to fully climb above the level of fat and salt here.

recipe_prep:

    name: Prepare your chorizo
    text: >
      Fry the chorizo in a skillet, smashing with a wooden spoon occasionally. Continue to cook
      until crumbly and very, very red, about 10-12 minutes. This can be refrigerated or frozen
      for use later.

    name: Shred your cheese
    text: >-
      If your cheese did not already come pre-shredded (it doesn't matter much for this recipe),
      go ahead and shred it now. Finer shreds will melt more quickly. This can be refrigerated or
      frozen for use later.

recipe_cook:
  -
    name: Preheat your oven
    text: >-
      Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Do not use convection at this point. If you have a steam oven,
      turn the steam off. You want this to heat from the bottom only if you have a rear heating element
      or roast setting.

    text: >-
      Line a 1/4 sheet pan with parchment paper. Lay down a single layer of chips. Then, add an amount of chorizo
      that will feel like too much. Add a layer of cheese, then some more chorizo, whatever other toppings you like, 
      some hot sauce, and more cheese. Repeat on top if you want two- (or three-) layer nachos. Use more cheese than
      you think.

    name: Bake your nachos
    text: >-
      Put your nachos in your preheated oven. Watch them closely until the cheese has melted but not browned, then
      move on to the next step.

    name: Toast your nachos
    text: >-
      Turn on your broiler with the nachos still inside. If you have convection broil this is a good time to use it.
      If you have multiple options for broil temperatures you want it to be a fairly low broil-- 450 to 500 degrees
      will still only take a few minutes and is much easier to control than, say, 1500 degrees. Once they're browned
      to your satisfaction, pull them out and serve immediately.

recipe_cleanup:
  -
    name: Pan cleanup
    text: >-
      Pull the parchment paper out of the pan and use a plastic pan scraper to get any burned-on cheese off. Then
      wash and rinse as normal. Easy!
