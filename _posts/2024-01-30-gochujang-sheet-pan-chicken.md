Just a quick note on this one for today. I made the [NYT gochujang sheet pan chicken](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020829-sheet-pan-gochujang-chicken-and-roasted-vegetables?ds_c=71700000052595478&site=google&network=g&campaign_id=1400169272&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA2eKtBhDcARIsAEGTG43y9kr8kNuM47Oyp0juSA7d5hfSKOepsbhTWVeaW5ctGTYTp3w3RtAaAvcTEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) with a few modifications and it was excellent. Following the suggestions in the "helpful notes" I:

* peeled the squash
* doubled the sauce
* cooked it on two sheet pans rather than 1
* put foil on the sheet pans
* used convection at 450 for 30 minutes, then lowered to 350 for another 10-12
* subbed in parsnips

and the results make it 100% rotation-worthy. I have a few other notes as well:

* I should have used one large bowl to make the sauce and coat the chicken/veggies. It would just have made less mess.
* I should have pickled the radishes and greens in a ziploc to reduce the amount of wasted rice vinegar
* A bit of time in a marinade wouldn't have gone amiss
* Maybe a bit more ginger as well
