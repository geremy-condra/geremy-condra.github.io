      Just shishito peppers washed, dried, and coated in a simple soy/miso/lemon juice sauce.
      The peppers were placed on a 1/4 pan sheet and put into the bottom rack of the Bighorn.
      They began to take color and then blacken immediately, even on the lowest settings. The
      result was perfect blistered shishito peppers in probably 30 seconds. I would seriously
      consider this as a fast-as-heck concession stand food option, but you really do have to
      pay attention: placed on an upper rack the pepper stems lit on fire.

      This is the real reason we got the Bighorn: making s'mores (fast!) at the Gambler 500.
      The good news is that on a low rack at the lowest temperature we were able to toast the
      marshmallows to just-charred and melt the chocolate to gooeyness within just a few seconds.
      The bad news is that the heat is so intense even on these low settings and low rack position
      that it's impossible to achieve browning on the marshmallows other than the char at the top.
      I personally don't mind that, but it was definitely a harbinger of what was to come.

      This was the prototype for the [Grizzled Wizard nachos](https://nibbles-and-bits.com/2024/01/25/the-grizzled-wizard-nachos.html).
      And at their best they came out better from the Bighorn than they did from the steam oven. They also came
      out faster. So, why is this only a 2 and the steam oven recipe is a 4?

      While these were delicious, you must be **absolutely certain** that every corner of every chip is covered with cheese, because
      the alternative is having chips burn way before the cheese could brown. There is also no possibility of multi-layered nachos,
      because the heat at the top is so intense that nothing underneath it will have had time to melt before the top burns.

      Searing is what the Bighorn is for, so it only seems fair to test it on that basis. Cutting to the chase, it is **excellent**
      at that. It is able to produce a deep sear without difficulty and even a pleasing amount of pyrolysis like you would get on
      the grill. If you are someone who really loves a well-seared steak, but hates smoking up your kitchen or firing up your
      grill to get it, this is a nearly-perfect way to do that. The only caveat is that the temperature felt on the surface of the
      food is very proportional to the distance from the heating element, and so anything with a rounded profile (like the back of
      the pork chop I tested this on) can get uneven color.

review_future_tests:
  - Test with the gas regulator at a lower setting. This may be difficult to repeat well, but may also convince the device to act
    more like a toaster oven.

The Bighorn is touted as being the final word on searing steak: a 1500 degree outdoor broiler capable of producing a
perfect crust every time. But a good broiler is one of the very most versatile tools in any kitchen, and especially
commercially tools like a salamander are virtually ubiquitous because of it. So I set out to buy one not only to
answer the question of whether it could make a good steak, but more broadly to determine if it could fill the role of
a salamander in my outdoor kitchen.
