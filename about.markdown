#Whoami
Hi, my name is Geremy Condra. I'm a general-purpose nerd living in Seattle, Washington. Thanks for stopping by.

You've stumbled onto my blog, which is mostly as a record of what recipes I've tried and how they've gone, along
with various other kitchen-y experiments. There may occasionally be other semi-structured posts, but if you think
of this as opening up your recipebook from a time when you were learning to cook you're in the right neighborhood.

Worth noting is that I do not claim to be especially good at making or eating food. Like probably everyone else I
have a few things I make that really snazzle my tastefeathers, but most of this is going to be pretty mediocre and
I try to be fair about that.

If you want to contact me, geremy.condra hat gmail dort com.

#Site policies

##Legal stuff
Yeah, so, don't rely on anything I say here or elsewhere. Nothing here is legal advice, good advice, advice for you,
no warranty express or implied, as-is-how-is-where-is, yadda yadda yadda.

##Copyright
It's all copyright 2024 Geremy Condra unless otherwise noted.

##Use of AI
I don't use generative AI much, but look, I wouldn't really be that surprised if it was a better cook than I am. I
make no promises about not using it. If you don't like to hear that I'm sure there's someone out there willing to
lie to you for the clicks.

##Affiliate links
Yeah, I use affiliate links. They don't cost you anything, don't cost me much of anything, and mean I don't have to
run a bajillion ads to maybe cover the cost of the domain name each year. If you like the content here and want to
see more of it the best way to do that is to email me with effusive praise or drive up with a truckload of cash. But
the next best way is to click affiliate links and buy things you were already gonna buy anyway.
